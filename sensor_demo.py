"""
v0.39 — end-to-end demo on the builder's sensor (ultrasonic distance + IR temp).

Wires the synthetic sensor dataset (make_sensor_dataset.py, modelling sensor.ino) through
the whole stack on HIS 2-channel domain:
  enroll 5 gestures (mean window per gesture)  ->  recognize held-out windows
  -> Interpreter maps gesture -> a sensor-appropriate command
  -> reflex fires on danger raw samples (too close / too hot), ahead of recognition
  -> a rewarded gesture's value rises (dopamine), under cortisol modulation.

Self-contained (generates its own data) so it runs in CI. Swap in the builder's real
captures (same format) and nothing else changes.
