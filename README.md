Store, search, and reason over data **in spike timing** — using sparse, binary,
event-driven spiking neural networks instead of dense floating-point tensors.

The question: **can we store and recall data with less computational power and less
storage space using spikes?** Every prototype here both demonstrates a mechanism and
*measures* the two target metrics (compute = synaptic operations, storage = bytes) against
a dense baseline. All results are reproducible — clone, run, read the printed metrics.
The pure-Python core has **zero dependencies**; only the real-data (MNIST) models use
PyTorch + snnTorch / BindsNET.

## What is this?

A "lake" of runnable spiking-network prototypes covering the three things a data system
does — **store** (associative memory, telemetry hub), **search** (in-storage SNN query
engine), and **reason** (relational spike-time embeddings) — plus the trainable models
(unsupervised STDP, spike-driven MoE) that learn the representations. Each file prints a
metrics block and ends with an `assert`-based self-check; CI runs every stdlib self-check
on each push.

## Architecture at a Glance

The three data-system paradigms (after an external architectural assessment), all complete:

| Paradigm | Capability | Implementation | Status |
|----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| **A** — telemetry hub | store + query multi-channel spike trains as sparse events | `spike_telemetry_hub.py` | ✅ complete (v0.12) |
| **B** — in-storage search | compile a query into an SNN, stream stored spikes, emit only matches (coincidence **and** temporal sequence) | `paradigm_b_engine.py` (+ `paradigm_b_genn.py` GPU) | ✅ complete (v0.20) |
| **C** — relational embeddings | a knowledge graph in spike timing; link prediction, anomaly scoring, full relation algebra (symmetric / inverse / composition) | `spike_knowledge_graph.py` (TransE), `spike_knowledge_graph_rotate.py` (RotatE), `spike_kg_relations.py` (algebra) | ✅ complete (v0.21–25) |

Trainable models (learn the representations):

| Model | Mechanism | File | Headline |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| Unsupervised STDP | rate-coded, adaptive threshold, hard-WTA | `snn_mnist_stdp.py` | 82.3% CPU |
| Conductance Diehl & Cook | exc/inh populations, BindsNET, GPU | `eth_mnist_bindsnet.py` | ~95% on GPU |
| Latency STDP | deterministic, precomputed, burst+x_tar | `snn_mnist_stdp_fast.py` | 76%, 2.1× faster |
| Spike-driven MoE + STDP | firing-rate routing over expert pops | `snn_moe_stdp_mnist.py` | 0-param router |
| GeNN custom plasticity | v0.17 rule as a CUDA weight-update model | `snn_mnist_stdp_genn.py` | GPU port |

## Quickstart

```bash
# Pure-stdlib — no install needed (these run in CI):
python spiking_storage_prototype.py      # associative memory + savings
python snn_classifier.py                 # supervised spiking classifier
python temporal_coding_storage.py        # TTFS latency coding (83× fewer ops)
python spike_telemetry_hub.py            # Paradigm A — sparse spike-train store
python paradigm_b_engine.py              # Paradigm B — coincidence + sequence queries
python spike_knowledge_graph.py          # Paradigm C — SpikE relational embeddings
python spike_knowledge_graph_rotate.py   # Paradigm C — RotatE cyclic relations
python spike_kg_relations.py             # Paradigm C — relation algebra (sym/inverse/composition)

# Real-data models — need deps (CPU build is fine):
pip install -r requirements.txt
python snn_mnist_stdp.py                                          # 74.6%
NORD_M=300 NORD_TRAIN=6000 NORD_TDECAY=0.99999 NORD_TPLUS=0.8 \
  python snn_mnist_stdp.py                                        # 82.3% (best CPU)
```

### GPU

The conductance Diehl & Cook path reaches the literature ~95% at 6400 neurons + 60k
images. On an RTX 5070 (Blackwell, sm_120) install the CUDA-12.8 build, then one switch:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install bindsnet
python eth_mnist_bindsnet.py --gpu        # 6400 neurons / 60k → ~95%
```

Verified end-to-end on an RTX 5070 (`torch 2.11.0+cu128`, capability 12.0). For the
accuracy-vs-neurons scaling law (400 → 1600 → 6400) run `bash gpu_scaling_sweep.sh`
(unbuffered, live progress).

## Competitive context

- **vs dense ANNs** — spiking inference does a synaptic op only when a neuron fires:
  3.6–83× fewer operations across these models, and spikes are 1-bit events vs 32-bit
  activations.
- **vs rate coding** — deterministic temporal (TTFS) coding cuts inference ~83×; latency
  STDP trains 2.1× faster at 7.9× fewer SynOps (at a measured −6.2 pt accuracy tradeoff).
- **vs the literature** — unsupervised STDP MNIST tops out at ~95% with 6400 neurons +
  full 60k (Diehl & Cook 2015); this repo reaches 82.3% on CPU and runs the 6400/95%
  config on GPU.
- **vs [Project Nord](https://github.com/gtausa197-svg/-Project-Nord-Spiking-Neural-Network-Language-Model)**
  (a 1B-param pure-SNN LLM) — the same primitives (LIF, STDP, sparse WTA / firing-rate
  MoE, attractor memory), scaled down to small, verifiable demos.

---

## Scope & roadmap

**What this is:** small, runnable, mostly-stdlib SNN prototypes that demonstrate and
measure the spike-based data-storage thesis. All three assessment paradigms (A/B/C) have
complete implementations.

**Lakehouse path (v0.26):** `lakehouse/medallion.py` follows the *single-node-feasible*
slice of a production "spiking neural data lakehouse" roadmap — the **Medallion**
topology (Bronze raw events → Silver binned/aligned → Gold features: firing rate,
population synchrony, inverse-compression ratio) over **columnar Parquet**, queried with
polars (the local Spark/Delta substitute), ending in a deterministic latency encoding =
the SNN handoff. **Production scale-out** (Spark clusters, Delta Lake/Iceberg ACID +
time-travel, Kafka streaming, Liquid Clustering, Unity Catalog, Delta Sharing,
format-preserving encryption, federated learning) needs cloud infrastructure and is
documented as the next-scale path, not implemented here.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full per-version history (every version is a git
tag + GitHub release).

## Limitations & open problems

- **~95% needs a GPU.** Conductance D&C hits ~95% only at 6400 neurons + 60k images
  (hundreds of CPU-hours); CPU ceiling is ~82–83%. A compute limit, not a method one.
- **Latency↔rate gap (−6.2 pts).** Deterministic latency STDP (76%) trails rate (82.3%) —
  an information gap (one deterministic pass vs many stochastic samples). A pair-based
  STDP kernel did **not** help (v0.18, kept opt-in, default off).
- **Determinism is mandatory for the query path.** Poisson re-encoding the same input
  gives different spike trains (Van Rossum ~13 vs 0), so stochastic encoding can't be used
  for identity/matching.
- **Paradigm B's real win needs neuromorphic silicon.** The CPU matcher is verified; the
  GeNN GPU port needs CUDA + a C++ compiler; line-rate in-storage search needs an NPU.
- **TransE can't do cyclic relations** — RotatE (phase coding) does (v0.22).

Numbers are fixed-seed; rerun to reproduce.

## Provenance

Designs come from two research briefs (in [`research/`](research/)) surveying SNN
data-storage methods, plus an external architectural assessment that mapped the concept to
the three paradigms above. The spike-driven MoE is a port of Project Nord's
`SpikeDrivenMoE`. License: [MIT](LICENSE).
