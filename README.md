# Spiking Neural Data Lake

A growing collection ("lake") of **spiking neural network** prototypes for **data
storage and retrieval**, built to answer one question:

> Can we store and recall data with **less computational power and less storage
> space** by using spikes — sparse, binary, event-driven — instead of dense
> floating-point activations?

Every prototype both *demonstrates* a spiking storage mechanism and *measures*
the two target metrics (compute = synaptic operations, storage = bytes/params)
against a dense baseline. Each version is committed and tagged so the progression
is auditable.

Most prototypes are **pure Python standard library — zero dependencies.** Only
the real-data (MNIST) files use PyTorch + snnTorch.

## The storage idea (one paragraph)

In a von Neumann machine, data sits in memory addresses and is shuttled to the
CPU to compute on. In these spiking nets, **data lives in the synaptic weights**
(written by a local Hebbian / STDP rule) and recall is just network dynamics —
storage and compute are co-located, so there is no shuttle. Two savings follow:
(1) a synaptic operation happens **only when a neuron spikes**, so compute scales
with sparsity, not with the dense matrix size; (2) spikes are **1-bit events**,
far cheaper to move and store than 32-bit activations, and sparse codes can be
stored as event lists (AER) instead of dense tensors.

```

Every script prints a metrics block and ends with a runnable `assert`-based
self-check.

## Provenance

The designs come from two research briefs (in [`research/`](research/)) surveying
SNN data-storage methods. The spike-driven MoE routing in v0.4 is a faithful port
of the `SpikeDrivenMoE` class from
[Project Nord](https://github.com/gtausa197-svg/-Project-Nord-Spiking-Neural-Network-Language-Model)
— a 1B-parameter pure-SNN language model — scaled *down* to a readable,
verifiable stdlib form. These prototypes are the bottom rungs of the same ladder
Project Nord climbs: same primitives (LIF, STDP, sparse WTA / firing-rate MoE,
attractor memory), small enough to actually check.

## Scope, related work & roadmap

**What this is:** a collection of small, runnable, mostly-stdlib SNN prototypes that
*demonstrate and measure* the spike-based data-storage / low-compute thesis —
associative memory, STDP feature learning, spike-driven MoE routing, and temporal
coding. Every file prints metrics and self-checks. **What this is not (yet):** a
production data-lake service. The name is the north star, not the current state.

An external architectural assessment (Gemini, v0.11) mapped the "spiking neural data
lake" idea to three paradigms; this repo currently lives in the algorithm layer and
treats them as a roadmap:

| Paradigm | Idea | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| **A** — spike telemetry hub | manage sparse multi-channel spike-trains (cf. `SpikeData`, HRLAnalysis) | **complete (v0.12)** — `spike_telemetry_hub.py`: indexed `.spk` store, partial-read windowed queries, bin/rate/ISI/burst |
| **B** — in-storage pattern match | compile queries to SNNs, search raw storage at line rate (cf. NPUsearch) | **complete (v0.13–20)** — `paradigm_b_engine.py` query engine: **coincidence + temporal-sequence** queries over the `.spk` store, partial-read, only-matches-to-host; `paradigm_b_genn.py` GeNN GPU port |
| **C** — relational spiking embeddings | encode data in spike *timing* (cf. the SpikE algorithm) | **complete (v0.11–21)** — TTFS + deterministic encode + Van Rossum matching, **and** SpikE knowledge-graph embeddings (`spike_knowledge_graph.py`): link prediction + anomaly scoring over spike-time triples |

**All three assessment paradigms now have complete implementations** (A: v0.12, B: v0.20, C: v0.21).
Paradigm C covers both **translational** relations (TransE, v0.21) and **cyclic** ones
(RotatE phase-coding, v0.22 — `spike_knowledge_graph_rotate.py`).

**Design principle (v0.18):** the query/router path must use **deterministic** encoding.
The same input has to encode to the same spike train or it can't be recognised as the
same query — Poisson re-encoding one MNIST image gives Van Rossum distance ~13 (looks
like different data) vs **0** for deterministic latency. Stochastic encoding is fine for
training augmentation, never for identity/matching.

**Ecosystem this builds on:** `snnTorch` (used here for LIF + NIR export path),
`SpikingJelly` (CUDA/Triton SNN training), `BindsNET` (used in v0.9 for conductance
Diehl & Cook), `SpikeData` (sparse spike-train management), `SpikE` (spike-time graph
embeddings), `NPUsearch` (in-storage neuromorphic search).

**Model math:** all neurons are Leaky Integrate-and-Fire,
`τ dU/dt = −U + R·I`, Euler-discretised per step, with threshold-reset; the v0.9
BindsNET path additionally uses conductance-based synapses with a decaying synaptic
current. Deferred infra from the assessment (Parquet storage tier, OpenTelemetry
observability, in-storage NPU execution) is intentionally out of scope for a
research-prototype repo.

## Limitations & open problems (current, v0.18)

**Resolved**
- ~~Associative memory isn't a byte-compressor (N×N matrix).~~ **v0.7:** factored to
  **O(P·k)** — store the P sparse patterns, reconstruct correlations on the fly.
  874× smaller, recall bit-identical, ~109× less compute.
- ~~Synthetic classifiers don't show capacity limits.~~ **v0.7:**
  `python snn_classifier.py sweep` traces the capacity curve (holds to ~30% pixel
  noise, falls to chance by 50%).
- ~~No explicit inhibition / unclear how to reach ~95%.~~ **v0.8:** three inhibition
  designs benchmarked — hard single-winner WTA + adaptive thresholds is the effective
  strong-inhibition limit; tuned homeostasis → 82.3%. **v0.9:** BindsNET conductance
  Diehl & Cook wired in and verified (100n/10k → 76%, on track to the paper's curve).

**Open / inherent tradeoffs**
- **~95% needs a GPU.** Conductance D&C hits ~95% only at 6400 neurons + all 60k images
  (hundreds of CPU-hours). `eth_mnist_bindsnet.py --gpu` runs it on CUDA (RTX 5070 =
  cu128). On CPU the verified ceiling is ~82–83% — a *compute* limit, not a method one.
- **Latency↔rate gap (−6.2 pts).** Deterministic latency STDP (76.0%) trails rate
  (82.3%). This is an **information gap** — one deterministic pass carries less than
  many stochastic Poisson samples — not a missing rule. Burst + x_tar LTD halved it
  (v0.17); a proper pair-based STDP kernel did **not** help (v0.18, degrades — kept
  opt-in, default off). Real closers: more neurons/data, or a non-WTA readout.
- **Determinism is mandatory for the query path.** Poisson re-encoding the same input
  yields different spike trains (Van Rossum ~13 vs 0), so stochastic encoding can't be
  used for identity/matching (v0.18). The deterministic encoder is a hard requirement,
  not a preference.
- **Paradigm B's real win needs neuromorphic silicon.** The CPU matcher is verified;
  the GeNN GPU port (`paradigm_b_genn.py`) needs CUDA 12.8 + a C++ compiler; true
  line-rate in-storage search needs an NPU (NPUsearch-class hardware).
- **Not a production data lake.** Parquet tier, OpenTelemetry, distributed storage are
  deliberately out of scope — this is a research-prototype lake proving the algorithms.

Numbers are fixed-seed; rerun to reproduce. Per-version detail in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
